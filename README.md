ðŸ”¥ Algerian Forest Fires â€“ Data Analysis Project

This project explores and analyzes the **Algerian Forest Fires Dataset**, focusing on identifying patterns and potential indicators of forest fires based on meteorological and environmental conditions.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview

- **File:** `Algerian_forest_fires_dataset_UPDATE.csv`
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Regions Covered:** Bejaia Region and Sidi-Bel Abbes Region, Algeria
- **Features Include:**
  - Temperature, Humidity, Wind, Rain
  - Fire Weather Index (FWI) components: FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI
  - Date, Month, Day
  - **Target Variable:** `Classes` (Fire / Not Fire)

ðŸ“Š Objectives

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Understand the key features that contribute to forest fires
- Build predictive models (optional):
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest or SVM
- Visualize the correlations and patterns in the dataset

ðŸ”„ Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Remove null values
   - Standardize feature formats
   - Encode target variable if needed

2. **EDA**
   - Summary statistics
   - Correlation matrix
   - Feature distributions (with Seaborn/Matplotlib)

3. **Modeling (Optional)**
   - Train/Test split
   - Classification model training
   - Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall

ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (for modeling)

ðŸ“Œ Insights

- Explore which weather features most strongly correlate with fire outbreaks
- Regional differences in fire occurrence
- Seasonal and monthly trends
